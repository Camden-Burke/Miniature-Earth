# Miniature Earth: A 3D Interactive Globe

Description:
"Miniature Earth" is an engaging 3D web project using three.js and React Three Fiber, designed to demonstrate basic concepts in web-based 3D graphics. The centerpiece of the project is a highly detailed, textured sphere representing Earth, set against a backdrop of stars to create a cosmic environment.

Key Features:

3D Earth Model: A realistic 3D sphere textured with a high-resolution Earth image, showcasing continents, oceans, and natural features.

Star Background: A starry sky background enhances the cosmic feel and visual depth of the project.

Orbital Controls: Users can interactively navigate around the Earth model, exploring from various angles and distances.

Ambient Light: Evenly distributed light across the globe highlights the textures and details on the Earth's surface.

Directional Light as Sunlight: Simulates sunlight, casting shadows and creating a day-night effect on the Earth model.

Responsive Design: The application adapts seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes.

Auto-Rotation Feature: When not being manipulated by the user, the Earth model will exhibit a slow, continuous spin animation. This subtle motion adds dynamism to the scene, mimicking the Earth's rotation and keeping the visual display active and engaging.

Objective:
This project showcases foundational skills in three.js and React Three Fiber, emphasizing 3D modeling, texturing, interactive controls, and lighting effects. The auto-rotation feature further demonstrates the developer's ability to create engaging, user-centric web applications with dynamic 3D elements.
