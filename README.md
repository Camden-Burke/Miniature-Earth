# Miniature-Earth
 "Miniature Earth" is an engaging 3D web project using three.js and React Three Fiber, designed to demonstrate basic concepts in web-based 3D graphics. The centerpiece of the project is a highly detailed, textured sphere representing Earth, set against a backdrop of stars to create a cosmic environment.
